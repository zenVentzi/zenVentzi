[What](https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/) is a senior engineer? Talk is cheap, show me [the-code](https://github.com/zenVentzi?tab=repositories). See my technical and team [views](https://www.zenventzi.com/blog/tech-software-engineering-views). A [quick engineering guide](https://www.zenventzi.com/blog/quick-engineering-guide-for-one-of-my-teams) I made for one of my teams. StackOverflow [questions](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4132182/zenventzi?tab=questions&sort=votes) and [answers](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4132182/zenventzi?tab=answers&sort=votes). See [what I read](https://www.zenventzi.com/blog/engineering-library). If you value:

- Not having to worry if your devs are slacking
- Knowing that your dev team is better than average
